            <listitem><para>(1) Modelling Canvas - this is your process drawing board. After dropping different shapes onto the canvas, you can move them around, connect them, etc. Clicking on a shape
                on the canvas allows you to set its properties in the expandable Properties Window (3) (as well as create connecting shapes and morph the shape into other shapes).</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>(2) Toolbar - the toolbar contains a vast number of functions offered by Designer (described later). These includes operations that can be performed on shapes present on the Canvas. Individual operations are disabled or enabled depending on what is selected. For example, if no shapes are selected,
                the Cut/Paste/Delete operations are disabled, and become enabled once you select a shape. Hovering over the icons in the Toolbar displays the description text of the operation.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>(3) Properties Panel - this expandable section on the right side of Designer allows you to set both process and shape properties. It is divided in four sections, namely "Core properties", and "Extra Properties, "Graphical Settings", and "Simulation Properties" are 
                is expandable. When clicking on a shape in the Canvas, this panel is reloaded to show properties specific to the shape type. If you click on the canvas itself (not on a shape) the section shows your general 
                process properties.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>(4) Object Repository Panel - the expandable section on the left side of Designer shows the jBPM BPMN2 (default) shape repository tree.
                It includes all shapes of the jBPM BPMN2 stencil set which can be used to assemble your processes. If you expand each section sub-group
                you can see the BPMN2 elements that can be placed onto the Designer Canvas (1) by dragging and dropping the shape onto it.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>(5) View Tabs - currently Designer offers functionality tabs for Process Modelling and Simulation. Process Modelling is the default tab. When users run process simulation, its results are presented in the Simulation tab.</para></listitem>
            <listitem><para>(6) Info Tabls - On the bottom Designer shows two different Info tabs. The Business Process tab includes the process modeling while the Metadata tab displays the process metadata such as created by and last modified information.</para></listitem>
