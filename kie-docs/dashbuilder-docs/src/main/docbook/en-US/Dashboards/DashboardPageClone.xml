  <title>Duplicating a page</title>

  <para>As mentioned earlier, another way to create new pages is to copy an
    existing one. We can do that via the '<emphasis>Duplicate current
      page</emphasis>' icon which is a much faster way to create pages. After
    clicking on the clone icon located at the toolbar, a page similar to the
    image below will be shown. From there we can select those instances we
    want to duplicate and those we want to keep as is (to reuse).
  </para>

  <mediaobject>
    <imageobject>
      <imagedata align="center" fileref="images/Dashboards/PageCloneWizard.png"/>
    </imageobject>
  </mediaobject>

  <para>Once finished, press the '<emphasis>Duplicate page</emphasis>'
    button and a brand new page will be created with the same name as the
    original one but starting with the prefix '<emphasis>Copy of</emphasis>'.
    Notice that if a panel instance is reused then any changes made to it will
    be reflected on all the pages where such instance is being used. this is a
    cool feature when we are defining for instance our navigation menus since
    we can define a single<emphasis>'Tree menu'</emphasis>panel and then
    configure all the pages to display the same menu instance.
