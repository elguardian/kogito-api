    <section>
      <title>Grouped accessors for nested objects</title>

      <para>We already allow nested accessors to be used as follows, where address is the nested object:</para>

      <programlisting>Person( name == "mark", address.city == "london", address.country == "uk" )</programlisting>

      <para>Now these accessors to nested objects can be grouped with a '.(...)' syntax providing more readable rules as
      it follows:</para>

      <programlisting>Person( name==  "mark", address.( city == "london", country ==  "uk") )</programlisting>

      <para>Note the '.' prefix, this is necessary to differentiate the nested object constrtaints from a method
      call.</para>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Inline casts and coercion</title>

      <para>When dealing with nested objects, we may need to cast to a subtype. Now it is possible to do that via the #
      symbol as in:</para>

      <programlisting>Person( name=="mark", address#LongAddress.country == "uk" )</programlisting>

      <para>This example casts Address to LongAddress, making its getters available. If the cast is not possible
      (instanceof returns false), the evaluation will be considered false. Also fully qualified names are
      supported:</para>

      <programlisting>Person( name=="mark", address#org.domain.LongAddress.country == "uk" )</programlisting>

      <para>It is possible to use multiple inline casts in the same expression:</para>

      <programlisting>Person( name == "mark", address#LongAddress.country#DetailedCountry.population &gt; 10000000 )</programlisting>

      <para>moreover, since we also support the instanceof operator, if that is used we will infer its results for
      further uses of that field, within that pattern:</para>

      <programlisting>Person(  name=="mark", address instanceof LongAddress, address.country == "uk" )</programlisting>
    </section>

    <section>
      <title>Conditional named consequences</title>

      <para>Sometimes the constraint of having one single consequence for each rule can be somewhat limiting and leads
      to verbose and difficult to be maintained repetitions like in the following example:</para>

      <programlisting>rule "Give 10% discount to customers older than 60"
when
    $customer : Customer( age > 60 )
then
    modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) };
end

rule "Give free parking to customers older than 60"
when
    $customer : Customer( age > 60 )
    $car : Car ( owner == $customer )
then
    modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) };
end</programlisting>

      <para>It is already possible to partially overcome this problem by making the second rule extending the first one like in:</para>

      <programlisting>rule "Give 10% discount to customers older than 60"
when
    $customer : Customer( age > 60 )
then
    modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) };
end

rule "Give free parking to customers older than 60"
    extends "Give 10% discount to customers older than 60"
when
    $car : Car ( owner == $customer )
then
    modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) };
end</programlisting>

      <para>Anyway this feature makes it possible to define more labelled consequences other than the default one in a single rule,
      so, for example, the 2 former rules can be compacted in only one like it follows:</para>

      <programlisting>rule "Give 10% discount and free parking to customers older than 60"
when
    $customer : Customer( age > 60 )
    do[giveDiscount]
    $car : Car ( owner == $customer )
then
    modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) };
then[giveDiscount]
    modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) };
end</programlisting>

      <para>This last rule has 2 consequences, the usual default one, plus another one named "giveDiscount" that is activated,
      using the keyword do, as soon as a customer older than 60 is found in the knowledge base, regardless of the fact that he
      owns a car or not. The activation of a named consequence can be also guarded by an additional condition like in this further example:</para>

      <programlisting>rule "Give free parking to customers older than 60 and 10% discount to golden ones among them"
when
    $customer : Customer( age > 60 )
    if ( type == "Golden" ) do[giveDiscount]
    $car : Car ( owner == $customer )
then
    modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) };
then[giveDiscount]
    modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) };
end</programlisting>

      <para>The condition in the if statement is always evaluated on the pattern immediately preceding it. In the end this last,
      a bit more complicated, example shows how it is possible to switch over different conditions using a nested if/else statement:</para>

      <programlisting>rule "Give free parking and 10% discount to over 60 Golden customer and 5% to Silver ones"
when
    $customer : Customer( age > 60 )
    if ( type == "Golden" ) do[giveDiscount10]
    else if ( type == "Silver" ) break[giveDiscount5]
    $car : Car ( owner == $customer )
then
    modify($car) { setFreeParking( true ) };
then[giveDiscount10]
    modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.1 ) };
then[giveDiscount5]
    modify($customer) { setDiscount( 0.05 ) };
end</programlisting>

      <para>Here the purpose is to give a 10% discount AND a free parking to Golden customers over 60, but only a 5% discount
      (without free parking) to the Silver ones. This result is achieved by activating the consequence named "giveDiscount5"
      using the keyword break instead of do. In fact do just schedules a consequence in the agenda, allowing the remaining
      part of the LHS to continue of being evaluated as per normal, while break also blocks any further pattern matching evaluation.
      Note, of course, that the activation of a named consequence not guarded by any condition with break doesn't make sense
      (and generates a compile time error) since otherwise the LHS part following it would be never reachable.</para>

      <title>Exposure of non-Java Bean compliant class members</title>

      <para>In response to a request (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/GUVNOR-1756) to be able to build a rule that bound
      a variable to the size of a java.util.List we have now exposed model class members that do not adhere to the Java
      Bean conventions. i.e. you can now select model class members that are not "getXXX" or "setXXX".</para>

      <para>A valid indicator has now been added to the asset lists as well as the asset editors. The indicator shows
      whether an asset is valid, invalid or if the validity of the asset is undetermined. For already existing assets
      the validity of the asset will remain undetermined until the next time either validation is run on the asset or
      the asset has been saved again.</para>

      Define a "from accumulate" or "from collect" in the usual manner and then choose "from entry-point" when defining
      the inner pattern. This feature is also available in Rule Templates and the guided web-based Decision Table's BRL

      <title>Guided Decision Table receives an Audit Log</title>

      <para>An audit log has been added to the web-guided Decision Table editor to track additions, deletions and
      modifications.</para>

      <para>By default the audit log is not configured to record any events, however, users can easily select the events
      in which they are interested.</para>

      <para>The audit log is persisted whenever the asset is checked in.</para>

      <title>Simulation Testing (unfinished prototype)</title>

      <para>Simulation testing allows you to test a sequence of events in Guvnor. This is very usefull for testing CEP
      use cases.</para>

      <para>The example below shows a testcase that calls <literal>fireAllRules</literal> twice: once after a little
      over 3 seconds and once after a little over 5 seconds:</para>

      <figure>
        <title>Prototype of the simulation testing GUI</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </figure>

      <para>Each simulation consists out of a number of paths: in the example above there is only 1 path. Each path
      consists out of number of steps: in the example above there are 3 steps. Notice how the timeline overview shows
      the steps and their relative time distance. The timeline can zoom in and out.</para>

      <para>Each step consist out of a number of actions: in the example above, the second step at 3 seconds does 2
      actions: fire all rules and data assertion. Actions, steps and paths can be added, moved and removed as
      needed.</para>

      <para>For more information, take a look at <link
      xlink:href="http://blog.athico.com/2012/08/simulation-testing-in-guvnor-first.html">the simulation testing
      video</link>. A simulation test asset stored in 5.5.0.Beta1 will not be readable in 5.5.0.Beta2. Feedback is
