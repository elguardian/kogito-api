  <title>Data Modeler</title>

  <para>Processes almost always have some kind of data to work with.  The data
  modeler allows non-technical users to view, edit or create these data models.

  <para>Typically, a business process analyst or data analyst will capture the
    requirements for a process or application and turn these into a formal set
    of interrelated data structures. The new Data Modeler tool provides an
    easy, straightforward and visual aid for building both logical and physical
    data models, without the need for advanced development skills or explicit
    coding.  The data modelers is transparently integrate into the workbench.
    Its main goals are to make data models into first class citizens
    in the process improvement cycle and allow for full process automation
    through the integrated use of data structures (and the forms that will be
    used to interact with them).</para>
