  <title>Additional options</title>

  <para>As stated before, both entities as well as entity fields require
    some of their initial properties to be set upon creation. These are by no
    means the only properties entities and fields have. Below we will give a
    detailed description of the additional entity and field
    properties.

      <listitem>
        <para>Description: this field allows the user to introduce some kind
          of description for the current entity, for documentation purposes
          only. As with the label property, this is conceptual information that
          will not influence the use or treatment of this entity or its
          instances in any way.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Role: this property allows the assignment of a Role to the
          entity. The Role is a concept inherited from Drools Fusion, which for
          the time being only allows one possible value ("Event"). An entity
          that is designated with this value will be treated by the rules engine
          as an event type Fact (See Drools Fusion for more information on this
          matter).

      <listitem>
        <para>Equals: checking this property for an entity field implies
          that it will be taken into account, at the code generation level, for
          the creation of both the equals() and hashCode() methods in the
          generated Java class. We will explain this in more detail in the
          following section.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Position: this field requires a zero or positive integer. When
          set, this field will be interpreted by the Drools engine as a
          positional argument (see the section below and also the Drools
          documentation for more information on this subject).
