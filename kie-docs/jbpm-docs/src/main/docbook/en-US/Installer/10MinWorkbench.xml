        <listitem>To manage your process definitions and instances, click on the "Process Management" menu option
          at the top menu bar an select one of available options depending on you interest:
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>Process Definitions - lists all available process definitions</listitem>
            <listitem>Process Instances - lists all active process instances (allows to show completed,
              aborted as well by changing filter criteria)</listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          </listitem>

        <listitem>Process definitions panel allow you to start a new process instance by clicking on the "Play" button.
          You will see a process form where you need to fill in the
          necessary information to start the process.  In this case, you need to fill in your username "krisv" and a
          reason for the request, after which you can complete the form and close the window. After process form
          window is closed process instance details panel will be shown. From there you can access additional details:
          <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>Process model - to visualize current state of the process</listitem>
            <listitem>Process variables - to see current values of process variables</listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
          The process instance that you just started is first requiring a self-evaluation of the user and is waiting until
          the user has completed this task.</listitem>

        <listitem>To see the tasks that have been assigned to you, choose the "Tasks" menu option on the top bar and select
          "Task List" (you may need to click refresh to update your task view).  The personal tasks table
          should show a "Performance Evaluation" task for you.  You can complete this task by selecting it and
          clicking the "View" button.  This will open the task form for performance evaluations.  You can fill
          in the necessary data and then complete the form and close the window.  After completing the task, you
          could check the "Process Instances" once more to check the progress of your process instance.  You
          should be able to see that the process is now waiting for your HR manager and project manager to also
          perform an evaluation.  You could log in as "john" / "john" and "mary" / "mary" to complete these
          tasks.</listitem>

        <listitem>After starting and/or completing a few process instances and human tasks, you can generate a report of
          what has happened so far.  Under "Dashboards", select "Process &amp; Task Dashboard".  By default, you will
          see predefined set of charts that allow to directly spot what is going on in the system. Charts can be
        customized as well which will be described in following chapters.</listitem>
