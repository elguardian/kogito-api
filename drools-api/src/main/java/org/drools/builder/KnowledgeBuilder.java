/**
 * <p>
 * The KnowledgeBuilder is responsible for taking source files, such as a .drl file or an xls file,
 * and turning them into a KnowledgePackage of rule and process definitions which a KnowledgeBase
 * can consume. It uses the KnowledgeType enum to tell it the type of the resource it is being asked to build.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Binaries, such as xls decision tables must use the URL based methods, so that an InputStream
 * can be obtained. Reader is only suitable for text based resources.
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Always check the hasErrors() method after an addition, you should not add more resources
 * or get the KnowledgePackages if there are errors; KnowledgePackages() will return empty
 * if there are errors.
 * <p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Simple example showing how to build a KnowledgeBase from an DRL rule resource.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
 * kbuilder.addResource( new URL( "file://myrules.drl" ),
 *                       KnowledgeType.DRL);
 * assertFalse( kbuilder.hasErrors() );
 * KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase();
 * </p>
 * 
 * <p>
 * Simple example showing how to build a KnowledgeBase from an XLS decision table resource.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
 * DecisionTableConfiguration dtconf = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newDecisionTableConfiguration();
 * dtconf.setInputType( DecisionTableInputType.XLS );
 * dtconf.setWorksheetName( "Tables_2" );
 * kbuilder.addResource( new URL( "file://IntegrationExampleTest.xls" ),
 *                       KnowledgeType.DTABLE,
 *                       dtconf );
 * assertFalse( kbuilder.hasErrors() );
 * KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase();

 * Simple example showing how to build a KnowledgeBase from an DRF flow resource.
 * <p>
 * <pre>
 * KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
 * kbuilder.addResource( new URL( "file://myflow.rf" ),
 *                       KnowledgeType.DRF);
 * assertFalse( kbuilder.hasErrors() );
 * KnowledgeBase kbase = KnowledgeBaseFactory.newKnowledgeBase();
 * </pre>
 * <p>
 * If there are errors a simple toString can print the errors
 * </p>
 * <pre>
 * if ( kbuilder.hasErrors() ) {
 *     log.exception( kbuilder.getErrors().toString() )
