  <title>Entities</title>

  <para>A data model consists of data entities which are a logical
    representation of some real-world data. Such data entities have a fixed set
    of modeller (or application-owned) properties, such as its internal
    identifier, a label, description, package etc. Besides those, an entity also
    has a variable set of user-defined fields, which are an abstraction of a
    real-world property of the type of data that this logical entity
    represents.
  </para>

  <para>Creating a data entity can be achieved either by clicking the "Create"
    button in the model browser section (see fig. "The data model browser"
    above), or by clicking the one in the top data modeller menu:

  <para/>

  <para>Some initial information needs to be provided before creating the new
    object:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>The object's internal identifier (mandatory). The value of this
        field must be unique per package, i.e. if the object's proposed
        identifier already exists in the selected package, an error message will
        be displayed.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>A label (optional): this field allows the user to define a
        user-friendly label for the data entity about to be created. This is
        purely conceptual info that has no further influence on how objects of
        this entity will be treated. If a label is defined, then this is how the
        entity will be displayed throughout the data modeller tool.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>A package (mandatory): a data entity must always be created within
        a package (or name space, in which this entity will be unique at a
        platform level). By default, the option for selecting an already
        existing package will be activated, in which case the corresponding
        drop-down shows all the packages that are currently defined. If a new
        package needs to be defined for this entity, then the "New package"
        option should be selected. In this case the new to be created package
        should be input into the corresponding text-field. The format for
        defining new packages is the same as the one for standard Java
        packages.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>A superclass (optional): this will indicate that this entity
        extends from another already existing one. Since the data modeller
        entities are translated into standard Java classes, indicating a
        superclass implies normal Java object extension at the generated-code
        level.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>Once the user has provided at least the mandatory information, by
    pushing the "Ok" button at the bottom of the screen the new data entity will
    be created. It will be added to the model browser's entity listing.
  </para>

  <para>It will also appear automatically selected, to make it easy for the
    user to complete the definition of the newly created entity, by completing
    the entity's properties in the Data Object Properties browser, or by adding
    new fields.
  </para>

  </figure>

  <note>
    <para>As can be seen in the above figure, after performing changes to the
      data model, the model name will appear with an '*' to alert the user of
      the existence of un-persisted changes to the model.
    </para>
  </note>

  <para>In the Data Modeller's object browsing section, an entity can be
    deleted by clicking upon the 'x' icon to the right of each entity. If an
    entity is being referenced from within another entity (as a field
    type), then the modeller tool will not allow it to be deleted, and an error
    message will appear on the screen.
