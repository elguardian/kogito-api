         <title>Process Management</title>
         
         <para>This chapter describes the screens related with the creation and management of 
                process definitions and process instances. 
         </para>
         <para>
                Once you have modelled and configured all the techncial details to run a process definition
                your process definition will appear in the Process Definitions List. Once you have the process
                in the Process Definition List, you can start new instances of it. 
                The following sections describes the features provided by each of these screens.
                You can find these screens under the Process Management Menu, in the jBPM Console NG or in Kie Workbench.

                <para>The process definition section is composed by two main screens: the Process Definition Lists and the
                       Process Definition Details.</para>

                       <para> The process definition list shows all the available process definitions that were deployed into the platform. 
                              Look at the Deployments section for more information about how to check all the deployment units available. </para>

                       <title>The Process Definition Details</title>
                       <para> The process definition details shows all the available information about the process definition. You can consider this
                              screen as a brief about the process model. You can quickly see if there is a Sub Process associated with it, or how many users and groups
                              are participating in the selected definition.

                              look at all the process instances for the selected process definition goint to Options -> View Process Instances.

                       <para>When you want to create a Process Instance usually a Form will be presented to introduce the information required
                              by the process to be started. Once you complete the form and click into the Start Process button, the instance will be created and
                              the details of the Process Instance will be displayed on top of the Process Definition Details. </para>
