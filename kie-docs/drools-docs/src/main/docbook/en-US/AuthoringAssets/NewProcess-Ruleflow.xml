    <title>Rule flows</title>

    <para>Rule flows: Rule flows allow you to visually describe the steps
    taken - so not all rules are evaluated at once, but there is a flow of
    logic. Rule flows are not covered in this chapter on the Guvnor, but you
    can use the IDE to graphically draw ruleflows, and upload the
    <filename>.rfm</filename> file to the Guvnor.</para>

    <para>Similar to spreadsheets, you upload/download ruleflow files (the
    eclipse IDE has a graphical editor for them). The details of Rule Flows
    are not discussed here.</para>
