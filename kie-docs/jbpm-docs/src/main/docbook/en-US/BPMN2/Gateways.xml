        <para>Allows you to create branches
        in your process.  A Diverging Gateway should have one incoming connection and two or
        more outgoing connections.  There are three types of gateway nodes currently
        supported:
          <itemizedlist>
           <listitem>
            <para>AND or parallel means that the control flow will continue in all outgoing
            connections simultaneously.</para>
           </listitem>
           <listitem>
             <para>XOR or exclusive means that exactly one of the outgoing connections will
             be chosen.  The decision is made by evaluating the constraints
             that are linked to each of the outgoing connections.  The
             constraint with the <emphasis>lowest</emphasis> priority number that
             evaluates to true is selected.  Constraints can be
             specified using different dialects.  Note that you should always make sure
             that at least one  of the outgoing connections will evaluate to true
             at runtime (the engine will throw an exception at runtime if it
             cannot find at  least one outgoing connection).</para>
           </listitem>
           <listitem>
             <para>OR or inclusive means that all outgoing connections whose condition evaluates
             to true are selected.  Conditions are similar to the exclusive gateway, except
             that no priorities are taken into account.  Note that you should
             make sure that at least one of the outgoing connections will evaluate
             to true at runtime because the engine will throw an exception at
             runtime if it cannot determine an outgoing connection.
             </para>
           </listitem>
          </itemizedlist>
        It contains the following properties:
        </para>
        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Id</emphasis>: The id of the node (which is unique within
            one node container).</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Name</emphasis>: The display name of the node.</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem>
            <para><emphasis>Type</emphasis>: The type of the split node, i.e., AND,
            XOR or OR (see above).</para>
          </listitem>
          <listitem><para><emphasis>Constraints</emphasis>: The constraints linked
            to each of the outgoing connections (in case of an exclusive or inclusive gateway).</para>
          </listitem>
        </itemizedlist>

          <para>Allows you to synchronize
          multiple branches.  A Converging Gateway should have two or more incoming connections
          and one outgoing connection.  There are three types of splits currently supported:
          <itemizedlist>
           <listitem>
            <para>AND or parallel means that is will wait until <emphasis>all</emphasis> incoming
            branches are completed before continuing.
            </para>
           </listitem>
           <listitem>
             <para>XOR or exclusive means that it continues as soon as <emphasis>one</emphasis> of its
             incoming branches has been completed.  If it is triggered from more than one
             incoming connection, it will trigger the next node for each of those triggers.</para>
           </listitem>
            <listitem>
              <para>OR or inclusive means that it continues as soon as <emphasis>all direct active paths</emphasis>
              of its incoming branches has been completed. This is complex merge behaviour that is described
              in BPMN2 specification but in most cases it means that OR join will wait for all active flows
              that started in OR split. Some advanced cases (including other gateways in between or repeatable timers)
              will be causing different "direct active path" calculation. </para>
