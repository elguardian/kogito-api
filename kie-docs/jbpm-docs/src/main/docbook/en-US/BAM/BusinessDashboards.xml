  <title>Business Dashboards</title>

  <para>BPM solutions are not only made up with processes, rules or forms but also with data belonging to the customer
    business domain. Such data is handled in the forms, the rules and, of course, the dashboards that are part of the
    solution. Usually, dashboards feed with data coming from several sources of information, from business domain entities
    persisted into relational databases to data hold in legacy systems. In order to cope with this kind of scenarios a
    generic highly customizable dashboard tooling is needed.
  </para>

  <para>It's obviously expected that a customer building a BPM solution want to track how its processes are performing.
    To do so the customer need a monitoring and reporting tool. This is the main reason why the Dashbuilder project has
    been included as a core module of the jBPM echosystem. Notice also that Dashbuilder, as an independent project, is
    not only used by jBPM but also by many other projects like, for example, JBoss Teiid a data virtualization system
    that allows applications to use data from multiple, heterogeneous data stores.</para>

  <note>Please, read the Dashbuilder book in order to get detailed information about how to build custom dashboards.</note>

  <para>An example of dashboard is the Sales Dashboard which comes built-in any installation of Dashbuilder.
