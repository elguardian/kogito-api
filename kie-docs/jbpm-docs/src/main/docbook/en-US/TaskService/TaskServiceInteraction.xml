  <title>Interacting with the Task Service</title>
       <para>
            In order to get access to the Task Service API it is recommended to let the Runtime Manager to make sure that 
            everything is setup correctly. Look at the Runtime Manager section for more inforamtion. 
            From the API perspective you should be doing something like this:
       </para>
      
       <programlisting>
              ...
              RuntimeEngine engine = runtimeManager.getRuntimeEngine(EmptyContext.get());
              KieSession kieSession = engine.getKieSession();
              // Start a process
              kieSession.startProcess("CustomersRelationship.customers", params);
              // Do Task Operations
              TaskService taskService = engine.getTaskService();
              List&lt;TaskSummary&gt; tasksAssignedAsPotentialOwner = taskService.getTasksAssignedAsPotentialOwner("mary", "en-UK");
              
              // Claim Task
              taskService.claim(taskSummary.getId(), "mary");
              // Start Task
              taskService.start(taskSummary.getId(), "mary");

              ...
       </programlisting>
       <para>
              If you use this approach, there is no need to register the Task Service with the Process Engine. 
              The Runtime Manager will do that for you automatically. If you don't use the Runtime Manager, you will be responsible for setting
              the LocalHTWorkItemHandler in the session in order to get the Task Service notifying the Process Engine when a task is completed, or
              the Process Engine notifying that a task has been created.
       </para>
       <para>
              In jBPM 6.x the Task Service runs locally to the Process and Rule Engine and for that reason multiple light clients can be created
              for different Process and Rule Engine's instances. All the clients will be sharing the same database (backend storage for the tasks).
