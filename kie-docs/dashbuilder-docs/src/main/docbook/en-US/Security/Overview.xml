  <title>Overview</title>

  <para>When we talk about security we refer to the ability to define
    authorization policies in order to grant or deny users access to a given
    resource. Therefore, we first have to define who are the target users and
    what are the resources we want to protect. As resources we have the
    following:
  </para>

  <itemizedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Workspace</emphasis>: A set of pages with a
        shared look and feel. It may contain one or more dashboards.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Page</emphasis>: A combination of panels
        spread all over the screen and tidy up according to a given layout. A
        dashboard is basically a page used for monitoring a set of
        indicators.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para><emphasis role="bold">Panel</emphasis>: A reusable and
        configurable graphical component ready to be embedded and used. f.i: a
        KPI panel, a tree menu panel or an HTML panel.
      </para>
    </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>As of users, the application doesn't own a user repository. Users are
    managed outside the application. This means the login itself is delegated to
    the application server. After login, the application
    server pass to the application both the id of the user and the roles he/she has.
    The full list of available roles are defined into the application's <emphasis>WEB-INF/web.xml </emphasis>file.
  </para>
