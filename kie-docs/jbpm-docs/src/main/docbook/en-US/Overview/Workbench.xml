  <title>Workbench</title>
 <para>Optionally, you can use one or more knowledge repositories to store your business processes
    (and other related artefacts).  The web-based designer is integrated in the Guvnor repository,
    which is targeted towards business users and allows you to manage your processes separately 
    from your application.  It supports the following:
      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>A repository service to store your business processes and related artefacts,
        using a GIT repository, which supports versioning, remote accessing (as a file system),
        and using REST services.</listitem>
        <listitem>A web-based user interface to manage your business processes, targeted towards
        business users; it also supports the visualization (and editing) of your processes (the web-based
        designer is integrated here), but also categorisation, scenario testing, and deployment.</listitem>
        <listitem>Collaboration features to have multiple actors (for example business users and
        developers) work together on the same process definition.</listitem>
      </itemizedlist>
      Workbench application covers complete life cycle of BPM projects starting at authoring phase, going through
      implementation, execution and monitoring.
