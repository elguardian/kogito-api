  <title>Process Dashboard</title>

  <para>The jBPM Process Dashboard is an specific use case of a dashboard feed from data coming from a relational
    database via SQL queries. In this case, the database tables consumed are:
    <emphasis>processinstancelog</emphasis>
    and
    <emphasis>bamtasksummary</emphasis>
    both belonging to the jBPM engine.
  </para>

  <para>From the data provider perspective there exists 3 data providers in charge of retrieving
    the data needed by all the key performance indicators of the jBPM Process Dashboard. These
    data provides are all defined in the Dashbuilder tooling data provider management screen.

  <para>From the end user perspective, the jBPM Process Dashboard has been designed to consume the data from the data
    providers defined above. It has been also designed has a panel fully integrated into the KIE Workbench environment

  <note>Notice, those are generic metrics not tied to any specific business process. Nonetheless, it's worth
    to mention that it would be very easy for customers to modify, extend or adapt this generic dashboard for custom needs.
    A customer could take the jBPM Process Dashboard as the base template for building a custom dashboard which mixes data
    coming from the jBPM engine plus data coming from its own business domain.
