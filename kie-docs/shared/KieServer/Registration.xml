  <title>Registering a server</title>

  <para>To register a new <emphasis role="bold">Kie Execution Server</emphasis> instance, click on
                     <emphasis role="bold">Deploy â†’ Rule Deployments</emphasis> in Business Central.
              This will open up the screen to show you any existing servers that you have
              registered. Click on Register to bring up the screen for entering details for a new
              server.</para>
       <para>Enter details of your new server by specifying the endpoint and giving it a unique and
              identifiable name. </para>
       <para>The endpoint should be the same you used to verify that the server was running in the
              previous section and looks like this:
                     <code>http://SERVER:PORT/CONTEXT/rest/server</code>. Also provide a unique
              identifiable name for this server. </para>
       <para>Although the username/password sections are not mandatory, unless you specifically take
              away the authentication required for your kie-server webapp, then you will need to
              enter these. These values should match the ones created in the previous section when
              you were installing this webapp with the role of <code>kie-server</code>.</para>
       <para>Click <emphasis role="bold">Connect</emphasis> to connect and register this server. If
              you have successfully entered all the details, your server will be listed in the Rule
              Deployments Screen. </para>
       <para>Common errors at this stage include issues like invalid username/password or the
              username not having the required <code>kie-server</code> role or the endpoint not
              being correct. All of these issues will give the same error: <emphasis role="italic"
                     >Can't connect to endpoint</emphasis></para>
