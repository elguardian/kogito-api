  <title>Process Fluent API</title>

      <para>While it is recommended to define processes using the graphical editor or
      the underlying XML (to shield yourself from internal APIs), it is also possible
      to define a process using the Process API directly. The most important process
      model elements are defined in the packages <code>org.jbpm.workflow.core</code> and
      <code>org.jbpm.workflow.core.node</code>.  A "fluent API" is provided that
      allows you to easily construct processes in a readable manner using factories.
      At the end, you can validate the process that you were constructing manually.
      </para>
      
      <section>
        <title>Example</title>

      <para>This is a simple example of a basic process with a script task only:</para>
      <programlisting language="java">
RuleFlowProcessFactory factory =
    RuleFlowProcessFactory.createProcess("org.jbpm.HelloWorld");
factory
    // Header
    .name("HelloWorldProcess")
    .version("1.0")
    .packageName("org.jbpm")
    // Nodes
    .startNode(1).name("Start").done()
    .actionNode(2).name("Action")
        .action("java", "System.out.println(\"Hello World\");").done()
    .endNode(3).name("End").done()
    // Connections
    .connection(1, 2)
    .connection(2, 3);
RuleFlowProcess process = factory.validate().getProcess();
KnowledgeBuilder kbuilder = KnowledgeBuilderFactory.newKnowledgeBuilder();
kbuilder.add(ResourceFactory.newByteArrayResource(
    XmlBPMNProcessDumper.INSTANCE.dump(process).getBytes()), ResourceType.BPMN2);
KnowledgeBase kbase = kbuilder.newKnowledgeBase();
StatefulKnowledgeSession ksession = kbase.newStatefulKnowledgeSession();
ksession.startProcess("org.jbpm.HelloWorld");</programlisting>
        
      <para>You can see that we start by calling the static <code>createProcess()</code>
      method from the <code>RuleFlowProcessFactory</code> class.  This method creates
      a new process with the given id and returns the <code>RuleFlowProcessFactory</code>
      that can be used to create the process.  A typical process consists of three parts.
      The header part comprises global elements like the name of the process, imports,
      variables,  etc.  The nodes section contains all the different nodes that are part of the
      process. The connections section finally links these nodes to each other
      to create a flow chart.</para>

      <para>In this example, the header contains the name and the version of the
      process and the package name. After that, you can start adding nodes to the
      current process. If you have auto-completion you can see that you have
      different methods to create each of the supported node types at your disposal.</para>

      <para>When you start adding nodes to the process, in this example by calling
      the <code>startNode()</code>, <code>actionNode()</code> and <code>endNode()</code>
      methods, you can see that these methods return a specific <code>NodeFactory</code>,
      that allows you to set the properties of that node.  Once you have finished
      configuring that specific node, the <code>done()</code> method returns you to the
      current <code>RuleFlowProcessFactory</code> so you can add more nodes, if necessary.</para>

      <para>When you are finished adding nodes, you must connect them by creating
      connections between them.  This can be done by calling the  method
      <code>connection</code>, which will link previously created nodes.</para>

      <para>Finally, you can validate the generated process by calling the
      <code>validate()</code> method and retrieve the created
      <code>RuleFlowProcess</code> object.</para>
