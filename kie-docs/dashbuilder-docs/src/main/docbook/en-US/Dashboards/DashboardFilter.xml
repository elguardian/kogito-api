  <title>Configuring filter and drill-down</title>

  <para>The '<emphasis>Filter &amp; Drill-down</emphasis>' panel allows for
    the quick definition of dynamic forms that will allow us to navigate
    troughout the data displayed by the dashboard. Once an instance of the
    '<emphasis>Filter &amp; Drill-down</emphasis>' panel is dropped on the
    oage we just have to select the '<emphasis>Edit content</emphasis>' option
    from the panel menu. After that, a popup window similar to the following
    will be displayed:

  <para>This is a filter configuration panel where we can set the filter
    behaviour. Let's focus first on the middle bottom part of the screen: the
    <emphasis>Data provider's property table</emphasis>, which lists the
    properties of ALL the data providers referred by the KPIs on the page. For
    example, if we are building a sales dashboard and all its KPIs are built
    on top of the same data provider called '<emphasis>Sales dasboard
      demo</emphasis>' then the system lists all the
    <emphasis><emphasis>data
      properties of the '</emphasis>Sales dashboard demo
    </emphasis>
    ' provider.
    Hence, only the properties we select as '<emphasis>Visible</emphasis>'
    will be part of the filter form. Aditionally, we can enable the drill-down
    feature for each property. If enabled then the system will redirect to the
    target page when the property is selected on the filter form. Below is an
    screenshot of the filter panel of the '<emphasis>Sales dashboard
      demo</emphasis>'.

  <para>As you can see the form is composed by all the visible properties
    selected. For each property the system reads its configuration by asking
    the underlying data provider. For label type properties a drop-down list
    is displayed, containing as options all the disctinct values of the data
    provider's column. When the user submits a change on the filter form then
    the following operations are carried out by the dashboard visualization
    engine:
  </para>

  <orderedlist>
    <listitem>
      <para>It reads the data sets for the target data providers. A data
        provider is in the target set if it contains the selected filter
        property.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>It applies a filtering algorithm in memory on the target data.</para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>If drill-down is enabled for the selected property then the
        target page is set as current and the steps #1 and #2 are repeated
        again.
      </para>
    </listitem>

    <listitem>
      <para>Finally, after filtering, all the sensible KPIs are updated in order to
        display the filtered data. By sensible, we mean a KPI which is
        displaying data that is being filtered.
      </para>
