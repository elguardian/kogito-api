    <title>Getting the sources</title>

    <para>The source code of each Maven artifact is available in the JBoss Maven repository as a source JAR. The same
    source JARs are also included in the download zips. However, if you want to build from source, it's highly
    recommended to get our sources from our source control.</para>

    <para>Drools and jBPM use <link xlink:href="http://git-scm.com/">Git</link> for source control. The blessed git
    repositories are hosted on <link xlink:href="https://github.com">GitHub</link>:</para>

    <para>Git allows you to fork our code, independently make personal changes on it, yet still merge in our latest
    changes regularly and optionally share your changes with us. To learn more about git, read the free book <link
    xlink:href="http://progit.org/book/">Git Pro</link>.</para>

    <title>Building the sources</title>

    <para>In essense, building from source is very easy, for example if you want to build the
    <firstterm>guvnor</firstterm> project:</para>

    <programlisting>$ git clone git@github.com:droolsjbpm/guvnor.git
...
$ cd guvnor
$ mvn clean install -DskipTests -Dfull
...</programlisting>

    <para>However, <emphasis>there are a lot potential pitfalls</emphasis>, so if you're serious about building from
    source and possibly contributing to the project, <emphasis role="bold">follow the instructions <link
    xlink:href="https://github.com/droolsjbpm/droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap/blob/master/README.md">in the README file in
    droolsjbpm-build-bootstrap</link>. </emphasis></para>
