  <title>Anatomy of Projects</title>
  <para>The process of researching an integration knowledge solution for Drools and jBPM has simply
    used the "droolsjbpm" group name. This name permeates GitHub accounts and Maven POMs. As
    scopes broadened and new projects were spun KIE, an acronym for Knowledge Is Everything, was
    chosen as the new group name.  The KIE name is also used for the shared aspects of the system;
    such as the unified build, deploy and utilization.</para>
  <para>KIE currently consists of the following subprojects:</para>

  <para>OptaPlanner, a local search and optimization tool, has been spun off from Drools Planner and
    is now a top level project with Drools and jBPM. This was a natural evolution as Optaplanner,
    while having strong Drools integration, has long been independant of Drools. </para>
  <para>From the Polymita acquisition, along with other things, comes the powerful Dashboard Builder
    which provides powerful reporting capabities. Dashboard Builder is currently a temporary name
    and after the 6.0 release a new name will be chosen. Dashboard Builder is completely
    independant of Drools and jBPM and will be used by many projects at JBoss, and hopefully
    outside of JBoss :)</para>
  <para>UberFire is the new base workbench project, spun off from the ground up rewrite. UberFire
    provides Eclipse-like workbench capabilities, with panels and perspectives from plugins. The
    project is independant of Drools and jBPM and anyone can use it as a basis of building
    flexible and powerful workbenches. UberFire will be used for console and workbench development
    throughout JBoss.</para>
  <para>It was determined that the Guvnor brand leaked too much from its intended role; such as the authoring
    metaphors, like Decision Tables, being considered Guvnor components instead of Drools components. This wasn't
    helped by the monolithic projects structure used in 5.x for Guvnor. In 6.0 Guvnor's focus has been narrowed to
    encapsulate the set of UberFire plugins that provide the basis for building a web based IDE. Such as Maven
    integration for building and deploying, management of Maven repositories and activity notifications via inboxes.
    Drools and jBPM build workbench distributions using Uberfire as the base and including a set of plugins, such as
    Guvnor, along with their own plugins for things like decision tables, guided editors, BPMN2 designer, human tasks.
    The Drools workbench is called Drools-WB. KIE-WB is the uber workbench that combined all the Guvnor, Drools and jBPM
    plugins. The jBPM-WB is ghosted out, as it doesn't actually exist, being made redundant by KIE-WB.</para>
