  <title>Remote API</title>
  
  <para>The workbench contains an execution server (for executing processes and tasks),
  which also allows you to invoke various process and task related operations
  through a remote API.  As a result, you can setup your process engine "as a service"
  and integrate this into your applications easily by doing remote requests and/or sending
  the necessary triggers to the execution server whenever necessary (without the need to
  embed or manage this as part of your application).</para>
  
  <para>Both a REST and JMS based service are available (which you can use directly),
  and a Java remote client allows you to invoke these operations using the existing
  KieSession and TaskService interfaces (you also use for local interaction), making
  remote integration as easy as if you were interacting with a local process engine.
