  <title>Introduction</title>
  <para>It's been a busy year since the last 5.x series release and so much has change.</para>
  <para>One of the biggest complaints during the 5.x series was the lack of defined methodolgy for
    deployment. The mechanism used by Drools and jBPM was very flexible, but it was too flexible.
    A big focus for 6.0 was streamling the build, deploy and loading(utilization) aspects of the
    system. Building and deploying now align with Maven and the utilization is now convention and
    configuration oriented, instead of programmatic, with sane default to minimise the
    configuration.</para>
  <para>The workbench has been rebuilt from the ground up, inspired by Eclipse, to provide a
    flexible and better integrated solution; with panels and perspectives via plugins. The base
    workbench has been spun off into a standalone project called UberFire, so that anyone now can
    build high quality web based workbenches. In the longer term it will facilitate user
    customised Drools and jBPM installations.</para>
  <para>Git replaces JCR as the content repository, offering a fast and scalable back-end storage
    for content that has strong tooling support. There has been a refocus on simplicity away from
    databases with an aim of storing everythign as as text file, even meta data is just a file.
    The database is just there to provide fast indexing and search via Lucene. This will allow
    repositories now to be synced and published with estbalished infrastructure, like
    GitHub.</para>
  <para>jBPM has been dramatically beefed up, thanks to the Polymita acquisition, with human
    tasks, form builders, class modellers, execution servers and runtime management. All fully
    integrated into the new workbench.</para>
    <para>OptaPlanner is now a top level project and getting full time attention.</para>
    <para>A new umbrella name, KIE (Knowledge Is Everything), has been introduced to bring our related technologies
      together under one roof. It also acts as the core shared around for our projects. So expect to see it a
      lot.</para>
