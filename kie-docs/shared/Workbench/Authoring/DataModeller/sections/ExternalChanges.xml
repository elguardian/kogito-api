  <title>Roundtrip and concurrency</title>

  <para>
  Current version implements roundtrip and code preservation between Data modeller and Java source code.
  No matter where the Java code was generated (e.g. Eclipse, Data modeller), the data modeller will only
  create/delete/update the necessary code elements to maintain the model updated, i.e, fields, getter/setters,
  constructors, equals method and hashCode method. Also whatever Type or Field annotation not managed by the
  Data Modeler will be preserved when the Java sources are updated by the Data modeller.
  </para>

  <para>
  Aside from code preservation, like in the other workbench editors, concurrent modification scenarios are still
  possible. Common scenarios are when two different users are updating the model for the same project, e.g. using the
  data modeller or executing a 'git push command' that modifies project sources.
  </para>

  <para>From an application context's perspective, we can basically identify
  two different main scenarios:</para>

  <section>
    <title>No changes have been undertaken through the application</title>

    <para>In this scenario the application user has basically just been
    navigating through the data model, without making any changes to it.
    Meanwhile, another user modifies the data model externally.</para>

    <para>In this case, no immediate warning is issued to the application
    user. However, as soon as the user tries to make any kind of change, such
    as add or remove data objects or properties, or change any of the existing
    ones, the following pop-up will be shown:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>External changes warning</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>
    </figure>

    <para/>

    <para>The user can choose to either:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Re-open the data model, thus loading any external changes, and
        then perform the modification he was about to undertake, or</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Ignore any external changes, and go ahead with the modification
        to the model. In this case, when trying to persist these changes,
        another pop-up warning will be shown:</para>

        <figure>
          <title>Force save / re-open</title>

          <screenshot>
            <mediaobject>
              <imageobject>
                <imagedata fileref="images/Workbench/Authoring/DataModeller/extchanges_forcesave_reopen.jpg"/>
              </imageobject>
            </mediaobject>
          </screenshot>
        </figure>

        <para>The "Force Save" option will effectively overwrite any external
        changes, while "Re-open" will discard any local changes and reload the
        model.</para>

        <warning>
          <para>"Force Save" overwrites any external changes!</para>
        </warning>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para/>
  </section>

  <section>
    <title>Changes have been undertaken through the application</title>

    <para>The application user has made changes to the data model. Meanwhile,
    another user simultaneously modifies the data model from outside the
    application context.</para>

    <para>In this alternative scenario, immediately after the external user
    commits his changes to the asset repository (or e.g. saves the model with the data modeller in a different session),
    a warning is issued to the application user:</para>

    <figure>
      <title>External changes warning</title>

          </imageobject>
        </mediaobject>
      </screenshot>
    </figure>

    <para/>

    <para>As with the previous scenario, the user can choose to either:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Re-open the data model, thus losing any modifications that where
        made through the application, or</para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Ignore any external changes, and continue working on the
        model.</para>

        <para>One of the following possibilities can now occur:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
          <listitem>
            <para>The user tries to persist the changes he made to the model
            by clicking the "Save" button in the data modeller top level menu.
            This leads to the following warning message:</para>

            <figure>
              <title>Force save / re-open</title>

              <screenshot>
                <mediaobject>
                  <imageobject>
                    <imagedata fileref="images/Workbench/Authoring/DataModeller/extchanges_forcesave_reopen.jpg"/>
                  </imageobject>
                </mediaobject>
              </screenshot>
            </figure>

            <para>The "Force Save" option will effectively overwrite any
            external changes, while "Re-open" will discard any local changes
            and reload the model.</para>
          </listitem>
