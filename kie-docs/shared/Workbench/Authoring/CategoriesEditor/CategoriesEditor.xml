  <title>Categories Editor</title>

  <para>Categories allow assets to be labelled (or tagged) with any number of categories that you define. Assets can
    belong to any number of categories. In the below diagram, you can see this can in effect create a folder/explorer
    like view of categories. The names can be anything you want, and are defined by the Workbench administrator (you can
    also remove/add new categories).</para>
  <note>
    <para>Categories do not have the same role in the current release of the Workbench as they had in prior versions (up
      to and including 5.5). Projects can no longer be built using a selector to include assets that are labelled with
      certain Categories. Categories are therefore considered a deprecated feature.</para>

    <title>Managing Categories</title>
    <para>The below view shows the administration screen for setting up categories (there) are no categories in the
      system by default. As the categories can be hierarchical you chose the "parent" category that you want to create a
      sub-category for. From here categories can also be removed (but only if they are not in use by any current
      versions of assets).</para>

    <para>Generally categories are created with meaningful name that match the area of the business the rule applies to
      (if the rule applies to multiple areas, multiple categories can be attached).</para>

  <section xml:id="wb.AddingCategoriesToAssets">
    <title>Adding Categories to assets</title>
    <para>Assets can be assigned Categories using the MetaData tab on the assets' editor.</para>
    <para>When you open an asset to view or edit, it will show a list of categories that it currently belongs to If you
      make a change (remove or add a category) you will need to save the asset - this will create a new item in the
      version history. Changing the categories of a rule has no effect on its execution.</para>
