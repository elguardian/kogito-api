       <title>User/Groups/Roles</title>
       <para>By default the KIE-Workbench uses the JBoss AS configured users to work. In order to
              create a new user we need to use the ./add-user.sh script located inside the /bin/
              directory. Using this script we will be creating all the users required by our
              business processes, and for that reason we will be also assigning them groups and
              roles. </para>

       <para>As you can see in the previous image, using the ./add-user.sh script you can create a
              new user for the Application User (first two options: option B, and empty realm). Note
              that you need to use different strings for the user name and for the password. For now
              you can create users with role admin, so it will have access to all the screens of the
              tool and then you can write the groups where the user belongs. In this case the user
              salaboy has Role: admin and he belongs to the IT group. There are some restricted
              words that cannot be used as group names. For now avoid using “analyst”, “admin”,
              “developer” for group names. </para>
