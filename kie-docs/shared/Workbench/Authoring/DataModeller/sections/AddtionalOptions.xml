  <title>Additional options</title>

  <para>As stated before, both entities as well as entity fields require
    some of their initial properties to be set upon creation. These are by no
    means the only properties entities and fields have. Below we will give a
    detailed description of the additional entity and field
    properties.

    <para/>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>Description: this field allows the user to introduce some kind
          of description for the current entity, for documentation purposes
          only. As with the label property, this is conceptual information that
          will not influence the use or treatment of this entity or its
          instances in any way.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>TypeSafe: this property allows to enable/disable the type safe behaviour for current type.
          By default all type declarations are compiled with type safety enabled. (See Drools for more information
          on this matter).
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>ClassReactive: this property allows to mark this type to be treated as "Class Reactive" by the Drools engine.
          (See Drools for more information on this matter).
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>PropertyReactive: this property allows to mark this type to be treated as "Property Reactive" by the Drools engine.
          (See Drools for more information on this matter).
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Role: this property allows to configure how the Drools engine should handle instances of this type: either as
          regular facts or as events. By default all types are handled as a regular fact, so for the time being the
          only value that can be set is "Event" to declare that this type should be handled as an event.
          (See Drools Fusion for more information on this matter).
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Timestamp: this property allows to configure the "timestamp" for an event, by selecting one of his attributes.
          If set the engine will use the timestamp from the given attribute instead of reading it from the Session Clock.
          If not, the engine will automatically assign a timestamp to the event.
          (See Drools Fusion for more information on this matter).
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Duration: this property allows to configure the "duration" for an event, by selecting one of his attributes.
          If set the engine will use the duration from the given attribute instead of using the default event duration = 0.
          (See Drools Fusion for more information on this matter).
        </para>
      </listitem>


      <listitem>
        <para>Expires: this property allows to configure the "time offset" for an event expiration.
          If set, this value must be a temporal interval in the form: [#d][#h][#m][#s][#[ms]] Where [ ] means an
          optional parameter and # means a numeric value.
          e.g.: 1d2h, means one day and two hours.
          (See Drools Fusion for more information on this matter).

          only. As with the label property, this is conceptual information that

          instances in any way.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Equals: checking this property for an entity field implies
          that it will be taken into account, at the code generation level, for
          the creation of both the equals() and hashCode() methods in the
          generated Java class. We will explain this in more detail in the
          following section.
        </para>
      </listitem>

      <listitem>
        <para>Position: this field requires a zero or positive integer. When
          set, this field will be interpreted by the Drools engine as a
          positional argument (see the section below and also the Drools
          documentation for more information on this subject).
