  <title>Getting Started</title>

  <para>If you like to take a quick tutorial that will guide you through most
  of the components using a simple example, take a look at the Installer
  chapter. This will teach you how to download and use the installer to create
  a demo setup, including most of the components. It uses a simple example to
  guide you through the most important features. Screencasts are available to
  help you out as well.</para>

  <para>If you like to read more information first, the following chapters
  first focus on the core engine (API, BPMN 2.0, etc.). Further chapters will
  then describe the other components and other more complex topics like
  domain-specific processes, flexible processes, etc. After reading the core
  chapters, you should be able to jump to other chapters that you might find
  interesting.</para>

  <para>You can also start playing around with some examples that are offered
  in a separate download. Check out the examples chapter to see how to start
  playing with these.</para>

  <para>After reading through these chapters, you should be ready to start
  creating your own processes and integrate the engine with your application.
  These processes can be started from the installer or be started from
  scratch.</para>
