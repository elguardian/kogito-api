  <title>Introduction</title>

  <para>The BRMS Execution Server is a standalone, out-of-the-box component that can be used to instantiate and execute rules via interfaces available for REST, JMS or a Java client side application. Created as a web deployable WAR file, this engine can be deployed on any web container.</para>  <para>This server has a low footprint, with minimal memory consumption, and therefore, can be deployed easily on a cloud instance. Each instance of this server can open and instantiate multiple Kie Containers which allows you to execute multiple rule services in parallel.</para>  <para>You can provision execution server instances via Business Central. In this chapter, we will go through the steps required to setup an execution server, provision and connect to this server via Business Central, control what rule artifacts go in each instance and go through its lifecycle.</para>
