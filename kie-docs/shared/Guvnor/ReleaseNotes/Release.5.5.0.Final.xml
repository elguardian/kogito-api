      <title>Improved consistency of BRL editor</title>

      <para>The Guided Rule Editor (BRL) has been made more consistent with
      the other editors in Guvnor.</para>

      <para>The left-hand side (WHEN) part of the rule is now authored in a
      similar manner to the right-hand side (THEN).</para>

      <title>Exposure of non-Java Bean compliant class members</title>

      <para>In response to a request
      (https://issues.jboss.org/browse/GUVNOR-1756) to be able to build a rule
      that bound a variable to the size of a java.util.List we have now
      exposed model class members that do not adhere to the Java Bean
      conventions. i.e. you can now select model class members that are not
      "getXXX" or "setXXX".</para>

      <para>If you import a Java POJO model be prepared to see more members
      listed than you may have had previously.</para>

      <title>Valid indicator for assets</title>

      <para>A valid indicator has now been added to the asset lists as well as
      the asset editors. The indicator shows whether an asset is valid,
      invalid or if the validity of the asset is undetermined. For already
      existing assets the validity of the asset will remain undetermined until
      the next time either validation is run on the asset or the asset has
      been saved again.</para>

      <title>Guided rule editor supports "entry-points" in Accumlates and
      Collects</title>

      <para>The guided rule editor now supports nesting entry-points in "from
      accumulate" and "from collect" constructs. Define a "from accumulate" or
      "from collect" in the usual manner and then choose "from entry-point"
      when defining the inner pattern. This feature is also available in Rule
      Templates and the guided web-based Decision Table's BRL fragment
      columns.</para>

      <title>Guided Decision Table receives an Audit Log</title>

      <para>An audit log has been added to the web-guided Decision Table
      editor to track additions, deletions and modifications.</para>

      <para>By default the audit log is not configured to record any events,
      however, users can easily select the events in which they are
      interested.</para>

      <para>The audit log is persisted whenever the asset is checked
      in.</para>

      <para>Once the capture of events has been enabled all subsequent
      operations are recorded. Users are able to perform the following:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para>Record an explanatory note beside each event.</para>
        </listitem>

        <listitem>
          <para>Delete an event from the log. Event details remain in the
          underlying repository.</para>

      <title>Guided Rule Editor - Remove frozen sections</title>

      <para>Sections of the Guided Rule Editor can become "frozen" if the Fact
      Type on which they rely is deleted from the available models, or the
      entire model is removed. Up until now the frozen section could not be
      removed and the whole rule had to be deleted and re-created from
      scratch. With this release frozen sections can be deleted.</para>

      <para>The section is also marked with an icon indicating the
      error.</para>

      <title>**INCUBATOR FEATURE** New Rule Asset - Scorecards</title>

      <para>A scorecard is a graphical representation of a formula used to
      calculate an overall score. A scorecard can be used to predict the
      likelihood or probability of a certain outcome. Drools now supports
      additive scorecards. An additive scorecard calculates an overall score
      by adding all partial scores assigned to individual rule
      conditions.</para>

      <para>Additionally, Drools Scorecards will allows for reason codes to be
      set, which help in identifying the specific rules (buckets) that have
      contributed to the overall score. Drools Scorecards will be based on the
      PMML 4.1 Standard.</para>

      <para>The New Rule Wizard now allows for creation of scorecard
      assets.</para>
