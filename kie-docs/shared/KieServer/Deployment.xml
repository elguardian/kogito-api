  <title>Deploying the Kie Execution Server</title>

  <para>The BRMS Execution Server is distributed as a web application archive (WAR) file with the name of kie-server.war. By default, when you install BRMS, this WAR file is installed and deployed in your web container. Consequently this gives you automatic access to this web application with the URL of http://SERVER:PORT/kie-execution-server/.</para>
  <para>You can of course, copy this WAR file and deploy it in any other web container (Red Hat JBoss Web Server or another EAP install, for example) and have this execution server available from other web containers. Note that you must deploy the WAR file that is compatible for your web container. The BRMS Execution Server bundled with the EAP install is only suitable for installation on another EAP install, while the one bundled with the Generic deployment is suitable for installation on Red Hat JBoss Web Server only.</para>

  <list><li>Once you have deployed this WAR file (or if you have it deployed on the same web container where BRMS is deployed), create a user with the role of kie-server in this web container.</li>
  <li>Test that you can access the execution engine by navigating to the endpoint in a browser window: http://SERVER:PORT/kie-execution-server/services/rest/server/ with the web container running. You will be prompted for your username/password that you created in the previous step.</li>
  <li>Once authenticated, you will see an XML response in the form of engine status, similar to this:<proglist><response type="SUCCESS" msg="Kie Server info"><kie-server-info><version>6.2.0.redhat-1</version></kie-server-info></response></proglist>
  </li></list>
